Here is how you can run this project:

This is simple CRUD for customer data (name, address & telephone number). 

Pre-requisites: Java SDK 1.8, Maven

Build project using maven and deploy to webserver like tomcat.

I have added 'Project-CustomerManagement-soapui-project.xml' to this project which can be used to test prepared REST api's. Please import 'Project-CustomerManagement-soapui-project.xml' into SoapUI and run.

Same project is 7 zipped and uploaded here with name api.7z'.

I have recorded deploying thee api's and running sample tests which can be found with name 'CRUD_customerdata.fbr' (Blackberry Flashback player is required to play this file)
